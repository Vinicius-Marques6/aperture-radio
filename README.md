# 🎧 Aperture Radio
![thumbnail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf0707b7-b6eb-4f6a-acc1-f2674b331e87)

This is a simple React project that uses Three.js and React Three Fiber to render the Portal 2 radio playing Still alive in a loop in 3D.

This was one of my first projects trying to use Three.js, at the beginning of 2023, and now I've decided to go back, update this repository and also release some new ones to document my journey.  I hope you like it! 😁
